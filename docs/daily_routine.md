#Daily Routine

It is my strong recommendation that you attempt to complete the following cycle every working day:


* 1 Session of [Lumosity](http://www.lumosity.com/) training
* Completion of one code kata from the problems sets outlined in this blog post:
  * [Sharpening The Sword](http://blog.developwithpassion.com/2011/09/sharpening-the-sword) - Look under the code katas section for a set of links to several code kata sites and associated problem sets.


For this week, the problem that I want you to work on is:

* [Dropbox Entry Problem - File Events](http://www.dropbox.com/jobs/challenges#file-events)
